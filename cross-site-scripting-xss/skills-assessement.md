<mark style="color:green;">**1- What is the value of the ‘flag’ cookie?**</mark>

* On the first page I saw that there was a search input and a “Welcome to Security Blog” link that takes you to a comments space with several inputs
* I set up a PHP server like the one used previously and used a simple payload in each field to test which one would be vulnerable

* Now that we know the vulnerable field, we can inject code to get the cookies, after all my server is already prepared for this, just create the script.js like the one used previously
