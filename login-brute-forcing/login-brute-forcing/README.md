# Login Brute Forcing



### <mark style="color:red;">What is Brute Forcing?</mark>

In cybersecurity, brute forcing is a <mark style="color:orange;">**trial-and-error method**</mark> used to crack passwords, login credentials, or encryption keys. It involves systematically trying every possible combination of characters until the correct one is found.&#x20;

The success of a brute force attack depends on several factors

* The `complexity` of the password or key. Longer passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols are exponentially more complex to crack.
* The `computational power` available to the attacker. Modern computers and specialized hardware can try billions of combinations per second, significantly reducing the time needed for a successful attack.
* The `security measures` in place. Account lockouts, CAPTCHAs, and other defenses can slow down or even thwart brute-force attempts.

### <mark style="color:red;">How Brute Forcing Works</mark>

The brute force process can be visualized as follows:

1. `Start`: The attacker **initiates the brute force process**, often with the aid of specialized software.
2. `Generate Possible Combination`: The software generates a **potential password or key combination** based on predefined parameters, such as character sets and length.
3. `Apply Combination`: The generated combination is attempted against the target system, such as a login form or encrypted file.
4. `Check if Successful`: The system evaluates the attempted combination. If it matches the stored password or key, access is granted. Otherwise, the process continues.
5. `Access Granted`: The attacker gains unauthorized access to the system or data.
6. `End`: The process repeats, generating and testing new combinations until either the correct one is found or the attacker gives up.

### <mark style="color:red;">Types of Brute Forcing</mark>

<table data-full-width="true"><thead><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th><th>Best Used When...</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>Simple Brute Force</code></td><td>Systematically tries all possible combinations of characters within a defined character set and length range.</td><td>Trying all combinations of lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' for passwords of length 4 to 6.</td><td>No prior information about the password is available, and computational resources are abundant.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Dictionary Attack</code></td><td>Uses a pre-compiled list of common words, phrases, and passwords.</td><td>Trying passwords from a list like 'rockyou.txt' against a login form.</td><td>The target will likely use a weak or easily guessable password based on common patterns.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Hybrid Attack</code></td><td>Combines elements of simple brute force and dictionary attacks, often appending or prepending characters to dictionary words.</td><td>Adding numbers or special characters to the end of words from a dictionary list.</td><td>The target might use a slightly modified version of a common password.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Credential Stuffing</code></td><td>Leverages leaked credentials from one service to attempt access to other services, assuming users reuse passwords.</td><td>Using a list of usernames and passwords leaked from a data breach to try logging into various online accounts.</td><td>A large set of leaked credentials is available, and the target is suspected of reusing passwords across multiple services.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Password Spraying</code></td><td>Attempts a small set of commonly used passwords against a large number of usernames.</td><td>Trying passwords like 'password123' or 'qwerty' against all usernames in an organization.</td><td>Account lockout policies are in place, and the attacker aims to avoid detection by spreading attempts across multiple accounts.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Rainbow Table Attack</code></td><td>Uses pre-computed tables of password hashes to reverse hashes and recover plaintext passwords quickly.</td><td>Pre-computing hashes for all possible passwords of a certain length and character set, then comparing captured hashes against the table to find matches.</td><td>A large number of password hashes need to be cracked, and storage space for the rainbow tables is available.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Reverse Brute Force</code></td><td>Targets a single password against multiple usernames, often used in conjunction with credential stuffing attacks.</td><td>Using a leaked password from one service to try logging into multiple accounts with different usernames.</td><td>A strong suspicion exists that a particular password is being reused across multiple accounts.</td></tr><tr><td><code>Distributed Brute Force</code></td><td>Distributes the brute forcing workload across multiple computers or devices to accelerate the process.</td><td>Using a cluster of computers to perform a brute-force attack significantly increases the number of combinations that can be tried per second.</td><td>The target password or key is highly complex, and a single machine lacks the computational power to crack it within a reasonable timeframe.</td></tr></tbody></table>
